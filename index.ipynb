    "\n",
    "This repository contains simulation and data analysis scripts used to obtain results for [Beg, M. et al. Stable and manipulable Bloch point. arXiv 1808.10772 (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10772).\n",

    "## Micromagnetic simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations scripts used to run micromagneyic simulations using [Finmag](https://github.com/fangohr/finmag) are in `src/` directory. In order to run them, please run\n",
    "\n",
    "    make all\n",
    "\n",
    "Micromagnetic simulations will be run inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, which contains all the necessary software. Therefore, please make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Runtime is approximatelly 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like only to reproduce the plots from the publication, there is no need to run micromagnetic simulations again, because all the `*.pkl` files required are already a part of this repository. However, VTK files of vector fields are not a part of it due to their size. Acordingly, if you would like to create them, please run micromagnetic simulations again (`make all`).\n",
