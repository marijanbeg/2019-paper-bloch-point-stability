## About

This repository contains simulation, data analysis, and plotting scripts used to obtain results reported in  

- M. Beg *et al.* Stable and manipulable Bloch point. [*Scientific Reports* **9**, 7959](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44462-2) (2019).

## Micromagnetic simulations

Simulation scripts used to run micromagnetic simulations using [Finmag](https://github.com/fangohr/finmag) are in `src/` directory. In order to run them all, please run

    $ make all

If you only want to reproduce the plots from the publication, there is no need to run micromagnetic simulations again, because all required `*.txt` files are already in this repository. However, VTK and HDF5 files of vector fields are not due to their size. Therefore, if you would like to create them, please run micromagnetic simulations again (`make all`). For the visualisation and the analysis of VTK files, package like [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) can be used.

### Docker

Micromagnetic simulations are run inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, which contains all necessary software. Therefore, please make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Runtime is approximatelly 2 hours.

Docker image required to run micromagnetic simulations is `marijanbeg/bloch_point:finmag` and it publicly available in [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/marijanbeg/bloch_point). If Docker is installed and `make all` is run, it will be pulled automatically. Alternatively, it can be obtained from the Zenodo record under DOI [10.5281/zenodo.2873744](https://zenodo.org/record/2873744). After downloading the Docker image file and before running `make all`, first run `make load-image`.

## Figures

Scripts for creating plots in Figures 2, 3, and 4 from the publication are in Jupyter notebooks which can be found in `figures/` directory. These notebooks can also be run in the cloud via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marijanbeg/2019-paper-bloch-point-stability/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/figures%2Findex.ipynb). This does not require you to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine.
