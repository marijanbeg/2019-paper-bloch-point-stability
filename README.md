## About

This repository contains simulation and data analysis scripts used to obtain results in [Beg, M. et al. Stable and manipulable Bloch point. arXiv 1808.10772 (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10772).

## Micromagnetic simulations

Simulation scripts used to run micromagnetic simulations using [Finmag](https://github.com/fangohr/finmag) are in `src/` directory. In order to run them, please run

    make all

If you would like only to reproduce the plots from the publication, there is no need to run micromagnetic simulations again, because all the `*.txt` files required are already a part of this repository. However, VTK files of vector fields are not a part of it due to their size. Accordingly, if you would like to create them, please run micromagnetic simulations again (`make all`). For the visualisation and the analysis of VTK files, package like [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) can be used.

#### Docker

Micromagnetic simulations will be run inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, which contains all the necessary software. Therefore, please make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Runtime is approximatelly 2 hours.

Docker image required to run micromagnetic simulations is `marijanbeg/bloch_point:finmag` and it publicly available in [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/marijanbeg/bloch_point). If Docker is installed and `make all` is run, it will be pulled automatically. Alternatively, it can be obtained from the Zenodo record under [10.5281/zenodo.2873744](https://zenodo.org/deposit/2873744) DOI. After downloading the Docker image file, before running `make all`, first run `make load-image`.

## Figures

Scripts for creating plots in Figures 2, 3, and 4 from the publication are in Jupyter notebooks which can be found in `figures/` directory. These notebooks can also be run in the cloud via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marijanbeg/2019-paper-bloch-point-stability/master?filepath=index.ipynb). This does not require you to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine.

Alternatively, if you decide to run notebooks on your machine, apart from Python 3, you will need to install the requirements:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
